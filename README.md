- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) (**FOSS alternative**) or compatible container runtime (**required for Aspire orchestration and cloud-native development**)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with C# extension, or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
- [Aspire Workload & Tooling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/setup-tooling) (**required to run AppHost**)

> This project is cross-platform and can be developed and run on Linux, Windows, and macOS. All features and tooling are supported on these operating systems.

> For more information on .NET Aspire, see the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/).

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danigutsch/BikeToursBooking.git
   cd BikeToursBooking
   ```

2. **Restore development tools**:
   ```bash
   dotnet tool restore
   ```

3. **Build the solution** (required before Playwright browser install):
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. **Install Playwright browsers (required for end-to-end UI tests)**:
   ```bash
   pwsh ./tests/TourBooking.Tests.EndToEnd/bin/*/playwright.ps1 install --with-deps
   ```
   > Use the wildcard (*) to match your build configuration and .NET version (e.g., Debug/net9.0 or Release/net9.0). For details, see the [Playwright .NET docs](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/intro).

5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/Aspire/TourBooking.AppHost
   ```

6. **Access the application**:
   - API: `https://localhost:7001`
   - Swagger UI: `https://localhost:7001/swagger`
   - Aspire Dashboard: `https://localhost:15888`

7. **Run all tests**:
   ```bash
   dotnet test --configuration Release
   ```
   - To run only unit tests: `dotnet test --filter "Category=Unit" --configuration Release`
   - To run integration/API tests: `dotnet test tests/TourBooking.WebTests --configuration Release`
   - To run end-to-end UI tests: `dotnet test tests/TourBooking.Tests.EndToEnd --configuration Release`

> Aspire-based tests require Docker or a compatible container runtime running.
> Playwright browsers must be installed before running E2E tests.
