## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Supported OS:** Linux, Windows, macOS
- [.NET SDK (latest stable)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)  
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/) (**FOSS alternative**) or compatible container runtime (**required for Aspire orchestration and cloud-native development**)
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with C# extension, or [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)
- [Aspire Workload & Tooling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/setup-tooling) (**required to run AppHost**)

> This project is cross-platform and can be developed and run on Linux, Windows, and macOS. All features and tooling are supported on these operating systems.

> For more information on .NET Aspire, see the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/).

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danigutsch/ToursBooking.git
   cd BikeToursBooking
   ```

2. **Restore development tools**:
   ```bash
   dotnet tool restore
   ```

3. **Build the solution** (required before Playwright browser install):
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. **Install Playwright browsers (required for end-to-end UI tests)**:
   ```bash
   pwsh ./tests/TourBooking.Tests.EndToEnd/bin/*/playwright.ps1 install --with-deps
   ```
   > Use the wildcard (*) to match your build configuration and .NET version (e.g., Debug/net9.0 or Release/net9.0). For details, see the [Playwright .NET docs](https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/intro).

5. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/Aspire/TourBooking.AppHost
   ```

6. **Access the application**:
   - API: `https://localhost:7001`
   - Swagger UI: `https://localhost:7001/swagger`
   - Aspire Dashboard: `https://localhost:15888`

7. **Run all tests**:
   ```bash
   dotnet test --configuration Release
   ```
   - To run only unit tests: `dotnet test -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/*/*[Category=Unit]" --configuration Release`
   - To run integration/API tests: `dotnet test tests/TourBooking.WebTests --configuration Release`
   - To run end-to-end UI tests: `dotnet test tests/TourBooking.Tests.EndToEnd --configuration Release`

> Aspire-based tests require Docker or a compatible container runtime running.
> Playwright browsers must be installed before running E2E tests.

## Development

### Architecture Patterns

#### Contracts Projects Pattern
Each major service includes a dedicated contracts project to facilitate integration and consumption by other applications:

- **`TourBooking.ApiService.Contracts`**: Contains DTOs, interfaces, and contracts for the main API service, enabling other services to integrate without tight coupling
- **`TourBooking.Web.Contracts`**: Provides contracts for the web application, supporting modular frontend development and potential micro-frontend architecture

This pattern promotes:
- **Loose Coupling**: Services can reference contracts without depending on implementation details
- **Versioning**: Contracts can be versioned independently from implementations
- **Integration**: External applications can consume services through well-defined contracts
- **Testing**: Contracts facilitate mocking and testing across service boundaries

### Key Design Principles

- **Domain-First Approach**: Business logic drives technical decisions
- **Eventual Consistency**: Distributed data consistency through domain events
- **Fail-Fast Validation**: Early input validation with comprehensive error handling
- **Immutable Value Objects**: Ensuring data integrity and thread safety
- **Rich Domain Models**: Business rules encapsulated within domain entities
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers and responsibilities
- **Cloud-Native Patterns**: Built for scalability and resilience
- **Developer Experience**: Fast feedback loops and productive tooling

### Testing Strategy

The project implements a comprehensive three-tier testing approach with integrated code coverage analysis:

#### Test Projects Structure
- **Unit Tests**: Domain logic testing with comprehensive business rule validation
- **Integration Tests**: API and service integration testing with containerized dependencies
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full application workflow testing using Playwright for UI automation
- **Shared Test Utilities**: Common testing infrastructure and helpers

#### Code Coverage Configuration
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Automated coverage analysis across all test types
- **External Assembly Filtering**: Automatically excludes external dependencies and generated code
- **Focused Coverage**: Analysis limited to `TourBooking.*` assemblies, excluding migrations and infrastructure noise
- **Multiple Formats**: Generates both XML (Cobertura) and HTML reports for CI/CD and local development

#### Running Tests with Coverage
```bash
# Run all tests with code coverage
pwsh ./scripts/run-coverage.ps1 -Configuration Release

# Include end-to-end tests in coverage
pwsh ./scripts/run-coverage.ps1 -Configuration Release -IncludeE2E

# Open coverage report in browser
pwsh ./scripts/run-coverage.ps1 -Configuration Release -OpenReport
```

#### Running Tests by Category

The project uses TUnit for testing, which requires specific syntax for filtering:

```bash
# Run unit tests only
dotnet test -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/*/*[Category=Unit]"

# Run integration tests only  
dotnet test -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/*/*[Category=Integration]"

# Run end-to-end tests only
dotnet test -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/*/*[Category=EndToEnd]"
```

> **Note**: TUnit uses `-- --treenode-filter` syntax for category filtering with `dotnet test`, unlike traditional xUnit/NUnit filtering.

#### Coverage Results
- **Coverage Reports**: Comprehensive HTML and XML coverage reports generated using ReportGenerator
- **Report Location**: `CoverageReport/index.html`
- **Filtered Assemblies**: Only includes `TourBooking.*` assemblies in coverage analysis, excluding migrations and external dependencies
- **Coverage Formats**: Supports Cobertura XML and HTML reports

#### Creating Coverage Badges
To create coverage badges for your repository:

1. **Generate Coverage Report**:
   ```bash
   pwsh ./scripts/run-coverage.ps1 -Configuration Release
   ```

2. **Extract Coverage Data**:
   The script generates badges in `CoverageReport/` directory:
   - `badge_linecoverage.svg` - Line coverage badge
   - `badge_branchcoverage.svg` - Branch coverage badge
   - `badge_combined.svg` - Combined coverage badge

3. **Add to README**:
   ```markdown
   ![Line Coverage](./CoverageReport/badge_linecoverage.svg)
   ![Branch Coverage](./CoverageReport/badge_branchcoverage.svg)
   ```

4. **Shields.io Integration**:
   Use the generated coverage percentage with [Shields.io](https://shields.io/):
   ```markdown
   ![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-XX%25-brightgreen)
   ```
   Replace `XX` with your actual coverage percentage from the report.

#### Planned Advanced Testing
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmark critical paths (tour search, booking creation, payment processing)
- **Load Testing**: Stress testing for concurrent bookings and high-traffic scenarios
- **Snapshot Testing**: Ensure API contract consistency and UI component stability over time
