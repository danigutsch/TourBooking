## Overview

> **ðŸš§ Project Status**: This is a new project currently in the planning and initial development phase. All features listed below are planned for implementation.

The **Bike Tours Booking Platform API** will provide a comprehensive framework for managing bike tours, customer bookings, inventory, and e-commerce operations. Leveraging **.NET 9** and the **.NET Aspire** ecosystem, this project will employ enterprise architectural patterns to ensure high availability, scalability, and testability for a seamless customer booking experience in cloud-native environments.

## Core Features

- **Tour Lifecycle Management**: Complete management of bike tours from creation to completion  
- **Customer Booking System**: Seamless reservation system with real-time availability  
- **E-commerce Integration**: Secure payment processing and order management  
- **Inventory Management**: Bike availability, maintenance tracking, and resource allocation  
- **Customer Management**: User profiles, booking history, and preference tracking  
- **Distributed Caching**: Improves performance for tour searches and availability checks with Redis  
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Ensures consistent state and real-time availability across microservices  
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Includes unit tests, integration tests, and health checks  

---

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture
- **Domain**: Core business models and logic for tours, bookings, and customers  
- **Application**: Use cases and interfaces for booking workflows and tour management  
- **Infrastructure**: Technical implementations (persistence, payment gateways, caching, external services)  
- **API**: HTTP endpoints and contracts for customer and admin interfaces  

### Domain-Driven Design
- **Bounded Contexts**: Logical separation of Tours, Bookings, Customers, and Payments sub-domains  
- **Rich Domain Models**: Business rules and invariants for tour scheduling, capacity, and pricing  
- **Aggregate Roots**: Transactional consistency boundaries for bookings and tour management  
- **Domain Events**: Publish/subscribe mechanism for booking confirmations, payment processing, and notifications  
- **Value Objects**: Immutable data types for tour dates, locations, pricing, and customer information  
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent language for domain experts, tour operators, and developers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)  
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)  
- Entity Framework Core tools:
  ```bash
  dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
  ```

### Running the Application

> **Note**: This is a new project in development. The following steps will be available once the initial implementation is complete.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/danigutsch/BikeToursBooking.git
   cd BikeToursBooking
   ```

2. **Start the infrastructure services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Update the database**:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update --project src/Infrastructure --startup-project src/API
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/AppHost
   ```

5. **Access the application** *(planned endpoints)*:
   - **API Documentation**: `https://localhost:7001/swagger`
   - **Customer Portal**: `https://localhost:7002`
   - **Admin Dashboard**: `https://localhost:7003`
   - **.NET Aspire Dashboard**: `https://localhost:15000`

### Test Credentials *(Planned)*
**Customer Account**:
- Email: `customer@biketours.com`
- Password: `Customer123!`

**Tour Operator Account**:
- Email: `operator@biketours.com`
- Password: `Operator123!`
